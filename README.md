A real-time system call monitoring and optimization tool enhanced with AI capabilities. This project leverages eBPF for system call monitoring, the Groq API for AI-driven optimization strategies, and Flask for an interactive web interface. It analyzes performance metrics like execution time and resource impact to suggest optimizations for resource-intensive system calls.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Uses eBPF to capture system call events as they occur.
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks execution time, CPU impact, memory impact, and disk I/O usage.
- **System Call Categorization**: Groups system calls into categories such as:
  - File I/O (e.g., `read`, `write`, `open`)
  - Memory (e.g., `mmap`, `mprotect`)
  - Process (e.g., `fork`, `execve`)
  - And more (Signal, IPC, Synchronization, etc.).
- **AI-Enhanced Optimization**: Generates strategies using the Groq API for high-performance system calls.
- **Rule-Based Fallback**: Provides optimization suggestions when the Groq API is unavailable.
- **Web Interface**: Built with Flask, offering visualization, filtering, and search capabilities.
- **Resource Impact Visualization**: Displays CPU, memory, and disk I/O impacts with color-coded bars.
- **Example Recommendations**:
  - For `select` (high CPU impact): "Consider using epoll instead of select for better scalability."
  - For `write` (File I/O): "Implement buffered I/O to reduce the frequency of write system calls."

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux with eBPF support (kernel version 4.1 or later recommended).
- **BCC**: BPF Compiler Collection installed for eBPF functionality.
- **Python**: Version 3.6 or later.
